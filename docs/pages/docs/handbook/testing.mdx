# Testing in a Monorepo

Along with linting and building, testing is a crucial part of a production-ready monorepo. Whether you're using end-to-end tests or a unit test suite, integrating them with Turborepo will lead to enormous speed-ups.

## Working with test runners

Let's say we have a monorepo that looks like this:

```
├── apps
│   └── web
│       └── package.json
└── packages
    └── shared
        └── package.json
```

Both `apps/web` and `packages/shared` have their own test suite. Their `package.json` files look like this:

<Tabs items={["Jest", "Vitest"]} storageKey="selected-test-runner">
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  }
}
```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Inside the root `turbo.json`, we recommend setting up a `test` task in your [pipeline](/docs/core-concepts/running-tasks):

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "test": {
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

Now, inside your root `package.json`

### Coverage reports

## End-to-end tests

## Running tests in watch mode

```
